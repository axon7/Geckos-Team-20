## Flight Fares application requirements:  

* The user can view the cheapest flight fares of _5 (fake number)_ _randomly selected_ destinations from  a list of the user's favorite countries.  
 
* Every time the user presses the _spacebar_ the previous destinations will be replaced by new ones  

* The user can _lock_ and _unlock_ a destination by pressing a button. Only the unlocked ones will be replaced after a _spacebar_ hit  

* The user can click on one of the destinations and reach the airline's website to buy the ticket directly  

* The user can share the link of a destination with friends on various social media   


#### If it's the user's first time on the app, the user must set:

 * The departure airport (he can do it either by geolocation or manually)  

 * _5 different_ favourite countries (from a list  or text input field or maybe an interactive map)  

 * The period of the year in which the user would be available to travel. The period can be specific (like _from 20/10/2018_ _to 30/12/2018_) or non-specific (like _anytime_ or _june_ or _from  june 2018 to november 2018_)   

  
The user can also change this settings whenever he wants
